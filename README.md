# PhDTools

A collection of tools I made to speed up common operations. Some tools require you to have sourced CCP4.

To install:

```
    git clone https://github.com/Dialpuri/PhDTools
    cd PhDTools
    pip install -e .
```

Tools (non-exhaustive list):

Fetch a PDB file:

`pdbfetch 1hr2`

Remove all non-protein/nucleic acid atoms and refine (will download data for you):
